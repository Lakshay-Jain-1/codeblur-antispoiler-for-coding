# Privacy Policy for CodeBlur

CodeBlur does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

All extension functionality—such as blurring solved code, tracking active time on coding platforms, and counting Run/Submit clicks—is handled entirely in the browser. No data is synced to any server, and no third-party services are used.

We do not track:
- Your browsing history
- Your identity
- Any personal information like email, age, location, IP, or credentials

All data related to usage (click counts, time tracking, blur state) is stored locally using Chrome's storage API.

If you have any questions, contact us at [jainlakshay502@gmail.com]
